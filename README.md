# 🧼 Clean Code – Live Lecture Notes

> **"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."** - Martin Fowler

This repository contains live-class notes based on the Udemy course **"Writing Clean Code"** by Academind (Maximilian Schwarzmüller). The goal is to reinforce key principles through real-time explanations, examples, and hands-on learning.

## 🎯 Course Overview

This course emphasizes writing code that's easy to read, understand, and maintain—not just by computers, but by humans (you and your team).

### 📋 Topics Covered

- ✅ **Meaningful naming** (variables, functions, classes)
- ✅ **Effective commenting** (minimal but impactful)
- ✅ **Clean formatting and structure**
- ✅ **Small, single‑responsibility functions**
- ✅ **Proper control‑flow** (guards, avoiding deep nesting)
- ✅ **DRY principle** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ **Side‑effect minimization**
- ✅ **Error handling best practices**
- ✅ **Data structures vs objects**
- ✅ **Class cohesion and SOLID principles**
- ✅ **Law of Demeter & other clean‑code patterns**
- ✅ **Real‑world transformations** from "bad → good" code

> **Languages:** Examples span Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript
