# 🧼 Clean Code – Live Lecture Notes

This repository contains live-class notes based on the Udemy course “Writing Clean Code” by Academind (Maximilian Schwarzmüller). The goal is to reinforce key principles through real-time explanations, examples, and hands-on exercises.

## 🎯 Course Overview

This course emphasizes writing code that’s easy to read, understand, and maintain—not just by computers, but by humans (you and your team).

Topics covered include:

- Meaningful naming (variables, functions, classes)
- Effective (but minimal) commenting
- Clean formatting and structure
- Small, single‑responsibility functions
- Proper control‑flow (guards, avoiding deep nesting)
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and side‑effect minimization
- Error handling best practices
- Data structures vs objects
- Class cohesion and SOLID principles
- Law of Demeter & other clean‑code patterns
- And many more real‑world transformations from “bad → good” code

Examples span Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
