# 🎯 Clean Code Mottos

- 🤝 **EMBRACE REFACTORING!**
- **Refactoring today is work you save tomorrow!**
- A codebase can only survive and stay maintainable if it's continuously improved and refactored.
- Whenever you add something new, **try** to improve existing code along the way.
- **Remember clean code when you write quick code!**
- **Names matter!**
