## Core Concepts

- **Clean code is not about whether code works or not.** Instead, it's about whether code is easy to read and understand.
- **Clean code does not require strong typing.** (Types can help prevent errors and improve readability)
- Some programming languages don't use strong typing, like JavaScript or Python.
- **Clean Code** â†’ Write code that is readable and easy to understand.
- **Patterns & Principles** â†’ Write code that is maintainable and extensible.
- Using all patterns and principles does not mean you are writing clean code. There are other things to consider, like naming conventions, etc. However, they can affect your clean code practices.
- **Clean Code** â†’ How to write the code || **Clean Architecture** â†’ Where to write which code
- The funny thing is, you will never write the best possible code from the start. Your code will be improved over time, which is totally normal.
- **Refactoring is your new friend** when it comes to writing clean code.
