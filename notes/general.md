# ðŸ“š General Notes

- Clean code is not about whether code works or not. Instead, it's about whether code is easy to read and understand.
- Clean code does not require strong typing. (Types can help preventing errors and can improve readability)
- Some programming language don't use strong typing like JS or pyhton.
- Clean Code => Write code which is readable & easy to understand.
- Patterns & Principles => write code which is maintainable and extensible.
- Using all patterns and principles does not mean that you are writing a clean code. They are other things to care of like naming and etc. But
  it can effect you clean code usage.
- Clean code => How to write the code || Clean Architecture => Where to write which code
- Funny thing is, you will never write the best possible code from the start. Your code would be improved over time which is totally normal.
- Refactoring is the new friend when it comes to write clean code.
