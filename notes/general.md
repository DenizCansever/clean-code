# ðŸ“š General Notes

> **"Clean code is not about whether code works or not. It's about whether code is easy to read and understand."**

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concepts

### What is Clean Code?

- **Clean code is not about whether code works or not.** Instead, it's about whether code is easy to read and understand.
- **Clean code does not require strong typing.** (Types can help prevent errors and improve readability)
- Some programming languages don't use strong typing, like JavaScript or Python.

### Key Distinctions

| Concept                   | Definition                                         | Focus                   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Clean Code**            | Write code that is readable and easy to understand | How to write the code   |
| **Patterns & Principles** | Write code that is maintainable and extensible     | Architecture and design |
| **Clean Architecture**    | Where to write which code                          | Code organization       |

### Important Notes

- Using all patterns and principles does not mean you are writing clean code. There are other things to consider, like naming conventions, etc. However, they can affect your clean code practices.
- **The funny thing is, you will never write the best possible code from the start.** Your code will be improved over time, which is totally normal.
- **Refactoring is your new friend** when it comes to writing clean code.

## ðŸ”„ The Refactoring Mindset

### Why Refactoring Matters

- **Continuous Improvement:** Code evolves and improves over time
- **Technical Debt Reduction:** Address issues before they become problems
- **Learning Opportunity:** Each refactor teaches you something new
- **Team Collaboration:** Cleaner code is easier for others to understand

### When to Refactor

- âœ… **After adding new features** - Improve existing code along the way
- âœ… **When you notice code smells** - Address them immediately
- âœ… **Before adding new features** - Clean up the area you'll be working in
- âœ… **During code reviews** - Apply feedback and suggestions
- âœ… **When fixing bugs** - Improve the code while fixing issues

### Refactoring Principles

1. **Small Steps:** Make small, incremental changes
2. **Test Often:** Ensure each change doesn't break functionality
3. **One Thing at a Time:** Focus on one improvement per refactor
4. **Meaningful Names:** Always improve naming when you see unclear names
5. **Extract Methods:** Break down large functions into smaller, focused ones

> **ðŸ’¡ Remember:** Clean code is a journey, not a destination. Every improvement, no matter how small, makes your codebase better for you and your team.
